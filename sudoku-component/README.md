# React-Sudoku

React-Sudoku is a react-powered implementation of [sudoku.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle game. The point of the game is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 - 9.

React-Sudoku generates random sudoku boards based on three difficulties (easy, medium, and hard) in the player's browser.
